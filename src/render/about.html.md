You've probably figured this out already, but my name is Sean Stoops and this my blog.

I don't have a lot to say. I plan to use this as a place to document certain things I do that others may find useful. Maybe I'll have a change of heart some day and this will become my literary masterpiece. But don't hold your breath.

Things you can expect to see here:

- Rock climbing things
- Bicycle things
- Sprinter van conversion things
