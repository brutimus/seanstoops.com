This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss."

Over the last few years, I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss.

In early 2015, I began thinking about upgrading to something bigger in order to be a little more comfortable on those rainy days and to enable me to take a little more adventure gear with me on those longer trips.

The problem was, since I already had a pretty decent-sized vehicle, upgrading to a small van just didn’t seem worth it — I’d spend a lot to upgrade but not gain a huge amount of space. But on the other hand, I didn't necessarily want to own a huge vehicle. I'd always scoffed at how unnecessarily big modern American vehicles were becoming. In the end, I decided to take the chance -- it was going to be my home for part of the time, so space was a necessity.

If I was going go forward with purchasing something new, I wanted it to meet a few requirements:

- Fuel efficient
- **Reliable**
- Semi off road worthy (good clearance)
- Maneuverable
- Space for climbing gear and bicycles
- **Stealth**

I began looking at my options -- everything from a Honda Element to an Astro Van, a Chevy Express to a Ford Econoline. Friends of mine had VW Westfalia vans and I knew those were not my cup of tea. A Sprinter van would never be in my budget, I thought, nor was I entirely sure I wanted one. They are awfully big and cumbersome, but that high fuel economy kept me thinking.

After ruling out the others as being not big enough to be worth the upgrade, or too fuel inefficient, I started looking around to see what a Sprinter could be had for.

After a month or so of casual searching the usual places -- eBay, Craigslist, etc. --  I began to realize lower prices could be found, but you have to act swiftly.

Just such a deal was posted to the [sprinter forums](http://sprinter-source.com) -- a 2004 Dodge Sprinter, 242,000 miles, minimal rust, for $6,000 flat. The owner was an active member of the forums which allowed me to see all the issues he had and how he fixed them. He appeared to be an upstanding and honest guy, so I decided to jump on the offer he made me.

After a $400 plane ticket and a 2,700 mile drive, I was back home with my shiny, albeit bug-splattered, cargo van.

That's the short version of it, anyways. This all actually took place in March - May of 2015. It is currently January of 2016 and I've finally been coaxed into writing up my experience.

Unfortunately, my build took place over the course of about six weeks. I didn't have time or the mental capacity to take too many photos. But I'll try my best to scrape together the few photos I do have and tell you how I managed to buy my van, build it out and keep it running for 20,000 miles and counting.
