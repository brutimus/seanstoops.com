Over the years, I’d spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. I loved it and never really sought anything better. My longest trip was somewhere around two to three months with a travel companion. It was tight, and we didn’t take much gear, but it was doable without much fuss.

I’d begun thinking about upgrading to something bigger in order to be a little more comfortable on those rainy days and to enable me to take a little more adventure gear with me on those longer trips.

The problem was, I already had a pretty decent-sized vehicle. Upgrading to a small van just didn’t seem worth it — I’d spend a lot to upgrade but not gain a huge amount of space.

The infamous *Sprinter Van* was sort of a dream vehicle, but I was certain it was out of my price range. That was until I buckled down and really started looking around. I soon realized that, while difficult, it was possible to find a perfect combination of age, mileage, rust and price. That perfect price landed be at (a probably non-repeatable) $6000. 

After a $400 plane ticket to Connecticut and a 2700 mile drive, I was back home with my shiney 2004 Dodge (rebranded Mercedes) Sprinter.

I plan to write a series of posts here outlining the process I went through from start to where I stand today. Topics will include:

- Purchase
- Mechanics
- Planning
- Buildout

Stay tuned for my (probably slow) progression!
