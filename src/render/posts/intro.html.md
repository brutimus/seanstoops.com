excerpt: "Over the years, I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss."

Over the years, I’ve spent quite a bit of time traveling, camping and living off and on in the back of my 2001 Ford Escape. This has been my dream vehicle for over a decade now: it's four wheel drive, seats four, sleeps two with room to spare and it's beefy enough to tow a trailer. I've traveled in it for months at a time. With two people traveling long term, it's tight and you can't take much gear, but it's doable without much fuss.

In early 2014, I began thinking about upgrading to something bigger in order to be a little more comfortable on those rainy days and to enable me to take a little more adventure gear with me on those longer trips.

The problem was, since I already had a pretty decent-sized vehicle, upgrading to a small van just didn’t seem worth it — I’d spend a lot to upgrade but not gain a huge amount of space.

The infamous *Sprinter Van* was sort of a dream vehicle, but I was certain it was out of my price range and the thought of something so big made me shudder. After a month or so of casual searching the usual places, I began to realize lower prices could be found, but you must be tedious and act quickly.

I ended up catching the perfect circumstances and landed a 2004 Dodge Sprinter for $6000 flat. It had 240,000 miles, ran well and had minimal rust considering it grew up in both Minnesota and Connecticut.

After a $400 plane ticket and a 2700 mile drive, I was back home with my shiney, albiet bug-splattered, cargo van.

I plan to write a series of posts here outlining the process I went through from start to where I stand today. Topics may include:

- Purchase
- Mechanics
- Planning
- Buildout

Stay tuned for my (probably slow) progression!
