The following is a synopsis of the van's condition at the time of purchase:

- Year: 2004
- Mileage: 242,000
- Previous owners: At least two
- Cab: Clean and in great condition
- Cargo area: Shelving and ceiling racks permanently installed
- Exterior: Minor rust around the bottom, especially the doors. Undercarrage a bit rusty.
- Previous owner had been up on all fluid changes using Mercedes Benz spec fluids
- Tires: Rears relatively new, fronts pretty worn
- Brakes: When I picked it up, I assumed they were in good shape as the PO had not mentioned them. However, on my trek to Kansas,  the front right began grinding very loudly. I then realized the pad had ground down to bare metal. I replaced them ASAP before continuing my journey.

During my drive home from Connecticut to Las Vegas, I stopped for a few days at my parentsâ€™ in Kansas. Here, I would have access to tools I did not have at home, primarily, an angle grinder.

I spent the better part of a two days stripping the interior of the cargo area, including:

- Remove all the shelving
- Remove the welded-on ceiling racks
- Remove the riveted-on wood floor
- Remove the bulkhead between the cab and cargo area
- Clean up all intertior rust, prime and repaint.

Once the van was stripped of all accoutrements, I was ready for the final leg of my trip home and to begin the build-out.

For a van with 242,000 miles, this cab is immaculate!

I was expecting worse than this given the New England roads.

No injector blow-by (black death)!

I guess the van had an alignment issue that got fixed before I purchased it. But you can see the damage it did to the front tire.

## Photos of the deconstruction process

I admit, I should have take a lot more photos. But this whole process was such a rush that I never stopped to pick up a camera!
