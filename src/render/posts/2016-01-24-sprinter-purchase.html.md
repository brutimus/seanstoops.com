*This post is not intended to be any form of financial advice. Your van purchase is your decision. I will simply outline my own experience which turned out pretty well. Good luck! =)*

At the beginning of my search for a van, the average price tag on the Craigslist listing I saw left me pretty disenchanted with the idea. I expected the prices to be higher than your average Astro van, but seeing old, rusted out, 300k mileage vans still listed for $20,000 was a shock. Luckily, these price tags only reflects the sellers hopes and dreams, not necessarily reality.

With a little persistence, planning and organization I began to see a more realistic picture of what a good condition van could be had for.

In order to keep the dizzying combinations of year models, mileage, conditions, locations, etc. straight, I wrote them all down in a spreadsheet. Once I had a few listed, I could begin to form a picture of what to expect to pay and which ones were the clear outliers.

The three sites I used for the majority of my search were:

- [ebay](http://www.ebay.com)
- [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com)
- [Sprinter Source](http://sprinter-source.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=14)

eBay is a good way to see what vans have actually sold for. When you perform your search filtering my year, price, etc., you can also filter by "Sold" to see what the historical selling prices have been.

Craigslist is nice because it's usually very easy to text or call the seller and get more information within minutes. However, I found that a lot of Craigslist posts tend to be overpriced.

Sprinter Source is a nice resource as oftentimes people in the know will comment on the listings saying whether they believe it to be a good or bad deal. On the flip side, it seems a lot of sellers avoid posting their van on the forums for this very reason. There have been a few examples of for sale listings exploding with forum members tearing apart the listing and ruining the seller's chances.

If you're new to the game and looking for a good starting point, here are a few:

- $7,500 should get you a T1N with >200k miles, decent interior and acceptable levels of external rust.
- $10,000 should get you the same as above, but with 150k miles or so.
- $15,000 should get you a very nice condition T1N with >100k miles, or an NCV3 with >200k
- $20,000 should get you an NCV3 in good condition inside and out with around 100k miles on it.
- $30,000 should get you an NCV3 in nearly new condition with very low miles.
- Anything above that and you should just go buy a new van. =)

When buying a van, or really any used car, it certainly helps to have a little mechanical knowledge. I recommend studying up on what issues are common to Sprinters and what to watch out for when reviewing your candidates.

I won't attempt to list all those items here as there are many resources out there with far greater details than I'm capable of, but the [T1N inspections tips post](http://sprinter-source.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5174) on the sprinter forums is a great place to start. There is a *lot* to learn, so take your time and thoroughly read about each issue they mention.
